##  DATA REVIEW TEMPLATE FOR VCRH YEAR 2024
This document presents the review of facility-targeted indicators for the year 2024, in alignment with the Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) framework for tracking key performance indicators (KPIs). The objective is to assess progress, identify areas of concern, and support data-driven decision-making.
Please find the attached template for insights and visualization.

###### REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH
Reproductive health remains a key pillar of service delivery at VCRH, with the facility consistently providing RH services in line with national standards. This is evidenced by strong performance indicators, such as high breastfeeding rates in postnatal care and quality neonatal services in the NBU (Newborn Unit). These achievements have earned recognition from various stakeholders, further highlighting the facility’s commitment to maternal and child health.

###### ANTENATAL AND CWC
At the beginning of the year, the number of mothers attending VCRH ANC services began to rise. However, this upward trend was disrupted by the industrial strike. Despite this setback, attendance gradually increased, with a mean of 289, a standard deviation of 67, a 75th percentile of 316(most of the time, attendance was lower than 316, and only in exceptional cases did it rise above.), and a maximum attendance of 381. This indicates that, despite disruptions, mothers still preferred VCRH for their ANC services.

Figure 1:ANC and CWC Attendance

In contrast, CWC attendance started at its peak but struggled to maintain numbers after the strike. The clinic recorded a mean attendance of 626 and a 50th percentile of 635(the data distribution is fairly symmetrical, meaning the attendance numbers were consistent without extreme variations.), showing relatively stable attendance levels. This suggests that, while mothers did not return for ANC services, they still preferred PNC clinics at the facility. However, attendance remained aff ected until November, likely due to the ongoing impact of the industrial strike.

###### Intermittent Preventive Therapy(IPT) Administration
Among the services off ered at the ANC, it is concerning to note that there was a stockout of IPT in the month of August. Despite this, the overall doses administered remained relatively stable throughout the period. This suggests that either existing stock was rationed before the shortage or alternative interventions were in place to maintain service continuity. However, the impact of the stockout on maternal health outcomes should be closely monitored to ensure uninterrupted access to essential ANC services.

###### Family Planning Services
Our clients show a strong preference for all family planning (FP) commodities except for Cycle Beads and Progesterone-only pills, which have notably low uptake. However, the minimal use of emergency contraceptive pills (E-pills) presents a challenge in interpretation—whether it refl ects low awareness or poor utilization by the public remains unclear.
Among the various methods, implants (1-rod and 2-rod) emerge as the most preferred, accounting for 70% of FP users.
![FP Services](image-4.png)
Figure 4: FP Commodities Utilisation

The majority of FP (Family Planning) clients were aged 25 and above, which is a positive indicator for the population. Given their age, it is assumed that they are well-informed about FP services, including where and how to access them.
However, the key population of concern remains adolescents (15-24 years old) and their ease of access to these services. Excluding April (due to service disruptions), July recorded the highest uptake of FP services among clients aged 15-24 years. This trend declined towards November, marking the end of the peak, with December showing minimal FP uptake across all age groups.
This pattern suggests a possible correlation between FP uptake and school/college closures, as uptake among the 15-24 age group tends to rise following holiday periods.

###### Maternity Deliveries
As one of the busiest sections of the facility, maternity deliveries consistently record high numbers. However, concerns arise as the number of Caesarean Sections (CS)—with a mean of 77 and a 50th percentile of 86—is nearly half that of Spontaneous Vaginal Deliveries (SVD), which have a mean of 167 and a 50th percentile of 187.
This trend is attributed to VCRH being the only public facility in Vihiga off ering CS services. Additionally, more than half of the CS procedures performed were emergency cases, highlighting the critical role the facility plays in handling obstetric emergencies.

###### Infant Deaths
The number of infant deaths at the facility remains considerably low relative to the total live births. On average, the facility records 3 infant deaths, with a maximum of 7 in a given period.
![Infant Deaths](image-7.png)
Figure 7:Trend of Birth Outcome

In 2024, 47% of infant deaths were attributed to prematurity, making it the leading cause. This was followed closely by asphyxia at 44%, which aligns with the high number of emergency Caesarean sections (CS) performed at the facility. Sepsis accounted for 8% of neonatal deaths, highlighting the need for continued neonatal care and infection prevention measures.

###### HIV/AIDS
The HIV/AIDS department remains a key area of investment within the facility. Analysis of the correlation between testing locations—community versus facility—and positivity rates reveals a stronger positive correlation between facility-based testing and the number of positive cases identifi ed. This indicates that facility-based HIV testing yields higher detection rates compared to community testing, emphasizing the need to prioritize and strengthen facility-based diagnosis efforts.
![HIV Correlation](image-9.png)
Table 1:Facility,Community, HIV positivity Correlation

In 2024, the HIV positivity rate stood at 0.006, a signifi cantly positive indicator that refl ects the eff ectiveness of ongoing HIV prevention interventions. However, sustaining these gains remains a concern, especially in light of the current USAID funding challenges.
The number of clients enrolled in HIV care began at 2,085 but saw a notable decline to 2,060 by year-end, indicating a drop in retention that warrants further investigation and intervention.
![patients on ART](image-10.png)
Figure 9:HIV Clients on ARVs

The decline in CCC (Comprehensive Care Clinic) clients from 2,085 to 2,060 could hypothetically be attributed to transfers out and deaths. However, a deeper analysis is needed to determine the exact causes of this decline. Notably, the net loss appears minimal based on cohort analysis, suggesting other factors may be influencing client retention.

###### OPD Clinics
Specialized clinics play a crucial role in patient management at the Outpatient Department (OPD). While eff orts have been made to minimize corridor bookings, there is still progress to be made in optimizing patient scheduling through the CHIS system and online appointment booking. The integration of SMS reminders for clinic dates and times is a will be a step forward in improving effi ciency and patient experience ,if implemented.
![opd](image-12.png)
Figure 10:Clinic Attendance Piechart

Medical attendance accounts for the largest share of OPD clinic visits at 31%, followed closely by the nutrition clinic at 26%. This highlights the signifi cant demand for general medical services, as well as the growing need for nutritional care, emphasizing the importance of both services in overall patient management

###### Cancer Screening and Palliative Care
Cancer is an increasing public health concern due to its high prevalence and severe impact on health. The cost of treatment led to the establishment of a dedicated cancer unit at the facility. However, data indicates that most patients seek services at an advanced stage, raising concerns about the effectiveness of early screening and public awareness efforts.
![cancer staging](image-13.png)
Figure 11:Cancer Staging

A significant portion of oncology patients are in Stage Four (31%), followed closely by those in Stage Three. Additionally, a large number of patients have no documented cancer staging, highlighting a gap in diagnosis and assessment.
![Cancer Distribution by Age](image-14.png)
Figure 12:Cancer Distribution by Age Group

Among newly diagnosed patients, the likelihood of developing cancer increases with age. Patients above 65 years were twice as likely to be diagnosed compared to those aged 51-65 and three times more likely than those aged 36-50.

![cancer distribution by anatomical site](image-15.png)
Figure 13:Cancer DIstribution by Anatomical site
The graph indicates that prostate cancer had the highest number of diagnoses, aligning with the large proportion of patients aged 65 years and above. Prostate cancer accounted for 175 cases, followed by oesophagus cancer with 151 cases. Cervical cancer remains a signifi cant concern with 76 cases, closely followed by breast cancer at 63 cases. These fi ndings highlight the need to enhance screening eff orts at ANC and PNC clinics and intensify health education initiatives. Additionally, stomach cancer (27 cases) and ovary cancer (20 cases) also warrant attention.

###### Sickling Test
A major concern in the lab tests is the rising trend of sickle cell cases. The prevalence of the condition appears to be signifi cant, signaling the need for increased attention and intervention.
